"""fn: The function to wrap a user interface (UI) around
inputs: The Gradio component(s) to use for the input. The number of components should match the number of arguments in your function.
outputs: The Gradio component(s) to use for the output. The number of components should match the number of return values from your function.
The fn argument is flexible â€” you can pass any Python function you want to wrap with a UI. In the example above, 
you saw a relatively simple function, but the function could be anything from a music generator to a tax calculator 
to the prediction function of a pretrained machine learning model."""
